            <p class="vital">Water is vital for all aspects of life, but human activity and population growth are depleting the amount of water resources available.</p>
            <p class="vital2">How did water go from ubiquitous resource to a global crisis? Data from the UN (Aquastat) and from water researchers (Hoekstra et al) show patterns of our water consumption footprints during 1996-2005.</p>
            <p class="vital2">
                The story of water is complex. But it's up to us to understand how water is used around the world in order to know how we might increase efficiency, safety, and sustainability for continued life on earth.
            </p>

            <p class="vital2">
                Similar to the carbon footprint concept, a water footprint is defined as the total volume of freshwater used, directly and indirectly, to produce the goods and services consumed. Water footprints of consumption serve as one important indicator to measure and understand world water use.

                    The factors that make up a country's water consumption include the sector where that water is used -- agricultural, industrial, and domestic. We can also look at the different sources of water these sectors use, shown on the visualization by the curved lines colored in green, blue, and grey.</p>
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Green" water, which falls as rainwater, is held in the soil and is used to grow crops. "Blue" water is fresh surface and groundwater, found in lakes, rivers, and aquifers. "Grey" water is the amount of freshwater required to dilute pollutants enough for safe consumption.</p>
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Internal" water refers to water resources used inside a country to produce its goods and services. "External" water refers to water used for the production of goods and services that are imported into and consumed within a country.</p>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Some facts of water use by sector:
                </p>

                <p>
                    Agriculture accounts for 70% of global water withdrawal. Excluding livestock, rice is one of the largest water consumers in the world - using 21% of the total volume of water used for crop production.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Industrial water consumption affects communities locally and internationally through trade. Apparel and footwear companies use a lot of water for the manufacturing of fabric and leather.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Domestic water consumption covers a wide variety of health, hygiene, and recreational purposes. Though it contributes relatively little to total water consumption, the kitchen source is the major contributor for most pollutants, and therefore, the amount of grey water associated with this sector.
