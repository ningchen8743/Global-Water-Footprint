            <p class="vital">Water is vital for all aspects of life, but human activity and population growth are depleting the amount of water resources available.</p>
            <p class="vital2">How did water go from ubiquitous resource to a global crisis? Data from the UN (Aquastat) and from water researchers (Hoekstra et al) show patterns of our water consumption footprints during 1996-2005.</p>
            <p class="vital2">
                The story of water is complex. But it’s up to us to understand how water is used around the world in order to know how we might increase efficiency, safety, and sustainability for continued life on earth.
            </p>
            <!--  <p class="vital2">According to FAO, "Renewable water resources are computed on the basis of the water cycle” and represent “the long-term average annual flow of rivers (surface water) and groundwater.”
                </p>

                <p class="vital2">
                “Non-renewable water resources are groundwater bodies (deep aquifers) that have a negligible rate of recharge on the human time-scale and thus can be considered non-renewable.”
                </p> -->
            <p class="vital2">
                Similar to the carbon footprint concept, a water footprint is defined as the total volume of freshwater used, directly and indirectly, to produce the goods and services consumed. Water footprints of consumption serve as one important indicator to measure and understand world water use.

        <p class="viz1text2">The US has the second highest footprint of water consumption per capita. Only the United Arab Emirates consumes more, because of its dry climate with low water resources and its high volume of water consumption.</p>
        <p class="viz1text3">Only subregions in Africa and Central America fall below the world average water footprint of 1,385 cubic meters of water used per person per year. Central Africa (1,092 m3/y) has the lowest average consumption, even though this region is rich in water resources. The regions with less than average consumption are also regions with the lowest UN rating of the Human Development Index, a statistical composite index for human development potential.</p>

We can also look at the different sources of water these sectors use, shown on the visualization by the curved lines colored in green, blue, and grey.</p>
                <p class="dataviz2text">“Green” water, which falls as rainwater, is held in the soil and is used to grow crops. “Blue” water is fresh surface and groundwater, found in lakes, rivers, and aquifers. Lastly, “grey” water is the amount of freshwater required to dilute pollutants enough for safe consumption.</p>
                <p class="dataviz2text">"Internal" water refers to water resources used inside a country to produce its goods and services. "External" water refers to water used for the production of goods and services that are imported into and consumed within a country.</p>

                    Some facts of water use by sector:
                    Agriculture accounts for 70% of global water withdrawal. Rice is one of the major crops feeding the world population. Excluding livestock, rice is one of the largest water consumers in the world - using 21% of the total volume of water used for crop production.
                    Industrial water consumption affects communities locally and internationally through trade. Apparel and footwear companies use a lot of water for the manufacturing of fabric and leather - 2,000 liters for one cotton T-shirt and 8,000 for a pair of leather shoes! Companies like The Gap and Nike have recently set targets to mitigate the impact on local water sources of the chemicals used in their dye houses and laundries.
                    Domestic water consumption covers a wide variety of health, hygiene, and recreational purposes: everything from bath, wash basin and laundry to kitchen, gardening, and swimming pools. Though domestic water usage contributes relatively little to total water consumption, the kitchen source is the major contributor for most pollutants, and therefore, the amount of grey water associated with this sector. In under-developed countries, untreated sewage carries a significant water footprint due to grey water.
