## Introduction
- This project first presents a global overview of water consumption, followed by several, detailed side-by-side comparisons between the United States and other countries around the world. Lastly, we aimed to provide further context on the possible tradeoffs when we use water: 
	+ how does water use affect societies?
	+ what can our use of water tell us about ourselves? 
- The overall goal was to learn how water consumption reveals both excess and undeveloped opportunities, with the ultimate aim to create urgency around collective water responsibility.
